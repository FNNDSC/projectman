# Overview
This repo is a "dummy" repo that contains an overview of FNNDSC projects, tasks, and assignees. the main purpose is to make a central location to add new projects to ZenHub and do "large scale" tracking/management. Specific single projects can of course have their own more finely grained ZenHub of detailed sub-tasks.
